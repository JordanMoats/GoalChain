# Goal Chain

Stop juggling complex OSRS goal dependencies in your head! Goal Chain is a RuneLite task tracker designed for how RuneScape *actually* works, where quests need skills, bosses need gear, and tasks unlock further tasks.

Simply add your goals and define their prerequisites. Goal Chain's power lies in the **Active Tasks** list: it automatically shows *only* the goals you can currently work on because you've completed the necessary steps.

Focus on progressing, not on figuring out *what* to progress next.

**Features:**
*   Create tasks quickly.
*   Easily define prerequisite tasks for any goal.
*   Instantly add follow-up tasks ("Next Steps") linked to prerequisites.
*   Automatic **Active Tasks** list shows only actionable goals.
*   Clear views for Pending (blocked) and Completed tasks.
*   Simple checklist interface with inline actions for managing tasks.
